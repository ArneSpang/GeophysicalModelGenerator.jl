### 2D Subduction setup

Lets start with creating a 2D model setup in cartesian coordinates, which uses the `CartData` data structure
=#
using GeophysicalModelGenerator

nx,nz = 512,128
x = range(-1000,1000, nx);
z = range(-660,0,    nz);
Grid2D = CartData(XYZGrid(x,0,z))

# Now we create an integer array that will hold the `Phases` information (which usually refers to the material or rock type in the simulation)
Phases = zeros(Int64, nx, 1, nz);

# In many (geodynamic) models, one also has to define the temperature, so lets initiate it
Temp = fill(1350.0, nx, 1, nz);

# #### Mechanical setup

# We will start with a simple subduction setup, which consists of a horizontal part:
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(-800,0.0), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = ConstantPhase(1));

# And with the inclined part:
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(0,300), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = ConstantPhase(1), DipAngle=30);

# Add them to the `CartData` dataset:
Grid2D = addField(Grid2D,(;Phases, Temp))

# Which looks like
Write_Paraview(Grid2D,"Grid2D_SubductionMechanical");
# ![Mechanical2D_Tutorial_1](../assets/img/Mechanical2D_Tutorial_1.png) 

# #### Add lithospheric layers
# In many geodynamic models, the lithosphere consists of a crust and mantle (or upper crust, lower crust and mantle lithosphere).
# We can use the function `LithosphericPhases` for this, which is a simple way to set a lithospheric layering. The layering here is defined by the `Layers` and `Phases` arguments, where `Layers` is a vector of the thickness of each of the layers (counting from the top) and `Phases` is a vector of the phase numbers for each layer.
lith = LithosphericPhases(Layers=[15 55], Phases=[1 2])

# and set the slab again:
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(-800,0.0), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith);
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(0,300), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith, DipAngle=30);

# Which looks like:
Grid2D = addField(Grid2D,(;Phases, Temp))
Write_Paraview(Grid2D,"Grid2D_SubductionMechanicalLayered");
# ![Mechanical2D_Tutorial_2](../assets/img/Mechanical2D_Tutorial_2.png) 

# #### Add halfspace cooling thermal structure
# So far, we only created the mechanical structure but not the thermal one.
# We can do that by specifying a thermal structure. For example, we can use the half-space cooling model:
therm = HalfspaceCoolingTemp(Age=40)
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(-800,0.0), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T=therm);
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(0,300), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T = therm, DipAngle=30);

# Which looks like:
Grid2D = addField(Grid2D,(;Phases, Temp))
Write_Paraview(Grid2D,"Grid2D_SubductionHalfspaceCooling");
# ![Mechanical2D_Tutorial_3](../assets/img/Mechanical2D_Tutorial_3.png) 

# Note that you can specify other 1D thermal profiles, such as 
# - `ConstantTemp`
# - `LinearTemp`
# - `HalfspaceCoolingTemp`
# - `LithosphericTemp`  - which takes radioactive heating into account
# - `SpreadingRateTemp` - which assumes that the plate moved away from a ridge and the thermal age increased accordingly
# - `McKenzie_subducting_slab` - temperature of a slab that is heated by surrounding mantle
#
# You can also average 1D profiles:
# - `LinearWeightedTemperature` - Average 2 1D profiles along a distance  

# #### Add a ridge
# Let's specify an oceanic thermal profile with a mid oceanic ridge at the left. For this, we use the `SpreadingRateTemp` function, and specify 
# a spreading velocity (note that this simply relates to the thermal structure and does not have to be the same as the subduction velocity you obtain in your geodynamic simulation).
lith = LithosphericPhases(Layers=[15 55], Phases=[1 2], Tlab=1250)
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(-800,0.0), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T=SpreadingRateTemp(SpreadingVel=3));

# For the subduction we use a thermal structure of a slab heated by hot asthenosphere 
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(0,300), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T = McKenzie_subducting_slab(Tsurface=0,v_cm_yr=3), DipAngle=30);

# We can set the mantle lithosphere that is hotter > 1250 C to mantle:
ind = findall(Temp .> 1250 .&& Phases .==2);
Phases[ind] .= 0;

Grid2D = addField(Grid2D,(;Phases, Temp))
Write_Paraview(Grid2D,"Grid2D_SubductionRidge");
# ![Mechanical2D_Tutorial_4](../assets/img/Mechanical2D_Tutorial_4.png) 

# #### Overriding slab and weak layer 
# Ok, lets add an overriding slab as well. For this, we use the `AddLayer!` function
lith = LithosphericPhases(Layers=[15 20 55], Phases=[3 4 5], Tlab=1250)
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(0,1000), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T=HalfspaceCoolingTemp(Age=80));

# The oceanic plate is as before
lith = LithosphericPhases(Layers=[15 55], Phases=[1 2], Tlab=1250)
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(-800,0.0), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T=SpreadingRateTemp(SpreadingVel=3));

# For the inclined part, we set a layer above the slab (the "weak" layer to facilitate subduction initiation )
lith = LithosphericPhases(Layers=[10 15 55], Phases=[6 1 2], Tlab=1250)
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(0,300), zlim=(-80.0, 10.0), phase = lith, T = McKenzie_subducting_slab(Tsurface=0,v_cm_yr=3), DipAngle=30);

# Lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary:
ind = findall(Temp .> 1250 .&& Phases .==2);
Phases[ind] .= 0;

Grid2D = addField(Grid2D,(;Phases, Temp))
Write_Paraview(Grid2D,"Grid2D_SubductionOverriding");
# ![Mechanical2D_Tutorial_5](../assets/img/Mechanical2D_Tutorial_5.png) 


# #### Curved slab - mechanics
# So far, the subducting part of the slab was always straight. We can also create a curved slab by using the `AddSlab!` function. This uses a parametric representation of the slab and is a bit more involved than the `AddBox!` function.

# We start with the horizontal part:
nx,nz = 512,128
x = range(-1000,1000, nx);
z = range(-660,0,    nz);
Grid2D = CartData(XYZGrid(x,0,z))
Phases = zeros(Int64, nx, 1, nz);
Temp = fill(1350.0, nx, 1, nz);
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(-800,0.0), zlim=(-80.0, 0.0), phase = ConstantPhase(1));    

# Next, we should define a `Trench` structure, which contains info about the trench which goes in 3D from `Start` - `End` coordinates (`x`,`y`)-coordinates respectively. As we are dealing with a 2D model, we set the `y`-coordinates to -100.0 and 100.0 respectively.
# Other parameters to be specified are `Thickness` (Slab thickness), `θ_max` (maximum slab dip angle), `Length` (length of slab), and `Lb` length of bending zoneof slab

trench = Trench(Start=(0.0,-100.0), End=(0.0,100.0), Thickness=80.0, θ_max=45.0, Length=300, Lb=200, direction=-1.0);
addSlab!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D, trench, phase = ConstantPhase(1));

# Add them to the `CartData` dataset:
Grid2D = addField(Grid2D,(;Phases, Temp))
Write_Paraview(Grid2D,"Grid2D_SubductionCurvedMechanical");
# ![Mechanical2D_Tutorial_6](../assets/img/Mechanical2D_Tutorial_6.png) 


# #### Curved slab - thermo-mechanics
# The `addSlab!` function has a few more interesting options. You can, for example, specify a weak decoupling layer above the slab which adds a weak layer between the subducting and overriding slab.
# You can also indicate a thermal structure for the slab, which can increase from a halfspace cooling model (of the horizontal part of the slab) to a slab that is heated by the surrounding mantle below a decouping depth `d_decoupling`.

# Our starting basis is the example above with ridge and overriding slab
nx,nz = 512,128
x = range(-1000,1000, nx);
z = range(-660,0,    nz);
Grid2D = CartData(XYZGrid(x,0,z))
Phases = zeros(Int64, nx, 1, nz);
Temp = fill(1350.0, nx, 1, nz);
lith = LithosphericPhases(Layers=[15 20 55], Phases=[3 4 5], Tlab=1250)

# Lets start with defining the horizontal part of the overriding plate. Note that we define this twice with different thickness to deal with the bending subduction area:
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(200,1000), zlim=(-150.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T=HalfspaceCoolingTemp(Age=80));
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(0,200), zlim=(-50.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T=HalfspaceCoolingTemp(Age=80));

# The horizontal part of the oceanic plate is as before:
v_spread_cm_yr = 3      #spreading velocity
lith = LithosphericPhases(Layers=[15 55], Phases=[1 2], Tlab=1250)
AddBox!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D; xlim=(-800,0.0), zlim=(-150.0, 0.0), phase = lith, T=SpreadingRateTemp(SpreadingVel=v_spread_cm_yr));

# Yet, now we add a trench as well. The starting thermal age at the trench is that of the horizontal part of the oceanic plate:
AgeTrench_Myrs = 800e3/(v_spread_cm_yr/1e2)/1e6    #plate age @ trench

# We want to add a smooth transition from a halfspace cooling 1D thermal profile to a slab that is heated by the surrounding mantle below a decoupling depth `d_decoupling`.
T_slab = LinearWeightedTemperature( F1=HalfspaceCoolingTemp(Age=AgeTrench_Myrs), F2=McKenzie_subducting_slab(Tsurface=0,v_cm_yr=v_spread_cm_yr, Adiabat = 0.0))

# in this case, we have a more reasonable slab thickness: 
trench = Trench(Start=(0.0,-100.0), End=(0.0,100.0), Thickness=90.0, θ_max=30.0, Length=600, Lb=200, 
                WeakzoneThickness=15, WeakzonePhase=6, d_decoupling=125);
addSlab!(Phases, Temp, Grid2D, trench, phase = lith, T=T_slab);

# Lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary:
ind = findall(Temp .> 1250 .&& (Phases.==2 .|| Phases.==5));
Phases[ind] .= 0;

Grid2D = addField(Grid2D,(;Phases, Temp))
Write_Paraview(Grid2D,"Grid2D_SubductionCurvedOverriding");
# The result is a smooth transition in thermal structure around the subduction zone:

# ### Other geometries
# We have a number of other functions to help create a geometry, specifically:
# 
# - `AddLayer!`
# - `AddSphere!`
# - `AddEllipsoid!`
# - `AddCylinder!`
#
# The help functions are quite self-explanatory, so we won't show it in detail here.
# If you have a topography surface or any other horizontal surface, you can surface with the cartesian grid with `aboveSurface` or `belowSurface`.
#
# Also, if you wish to take a seismic tomography as inspiration to set a slab geometry, you can interpolate it to a `CartGrid` with the same dimensions and use that with the julia `findall` function.
