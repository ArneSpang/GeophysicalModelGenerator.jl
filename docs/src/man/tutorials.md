# Tutorials

The best way to learn how to use julia and GeophysicalModelGenerator to visualize your data is to look at the tutorials. We have a range of tutorials that show the functionality of `GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl` (see sidebar). They are mostly stand-alone so it doesn't matter in which order they are executed.
The input scripts for the tutorials are available under `/tutorials`.
