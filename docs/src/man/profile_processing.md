# Profile processing

We have number of routines that makes it easier to read various datasets into `GMG` & create profiles through that data
The routines provided here have the following functionality:
- Read datasets (remote or local) that contains volumetric, surface, point, topograpy or screenshot data
- Define a profile (horizontal, vertical) with space for (projected) data
- Project earthquake (point) data onto the profile or intersect surfaces with a vertical profile (e.g., Moho data)
