 abstractNote={The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software is ubiquitous in the Earth and ocean sciences. As a cross‐platform tool producing high‐quality maps and ﬁgures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new “modern mode” to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls “classic mode.” GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations. Plain Language Summary The Generic Mapping Tools software is widely used in Earth and ocean sciences to process data and make maps and illustrations. This new version simpliﬁes usage, adds quick access to key data sets, and provides a tool for making scientiﬁc animations.},

 @article{DeLaVarga_Schaaf_Wellmann_2019, title={GemPy 1.0: open-source stochastic geological modeling and inversion}, volume={12}, ISSN={1991-9603}, DOI={10.5194/gmd-12-1-2019}, abstractNote={The representation of subsurface structures is an essential aspect of a wide variety of geoscientiﬁc investigations and applications, ranging from geoﬂuid reservoir studies, over raw material investigations, to geosequestration, as well as many branches of geoscientiﬁc research and applications in geological surveys. A wide range of methods exist to generate geological models. However, the powerful methods are behind a paywall in expensive commercial packages. We present here a full open-source geomodeling method, based on an implicit potential-ﬁeld interpolation approach. The interpolation algorithm is comparable to implementations in commercial packages and capable of constructing complex full 3-D geological models, including fault networks, fault–surface interactions, unconformities and dome structures. This algorithm is implemented in the programming language Python, making use of a highly efﬁcient underlying library for efﬁcient code generation (Theano) that enables a direct execution on GPUs. The functionality can be separated into the core aspects required to generate 3-D geological models and additional assets for advanced scientiﬁc investigations. These assets provide the full power behind our approach, as they enable the link to machine-learning and Bayesian inference frameworks and thus a path to stochastic geological modeling and inversions. In addition, we provide methods to analyze model topology and to compute gravity ﬁelds on the basis of the geological models and assigned density values. In summary, we provide a basis for open scientiﬁc research using geological models, with the aim to foster reproducible research in the ﬁeld of geomodeling.}, number={1}, journal={Geoscientific Model Development}, author={De La Varga, Miguel and Schaaf, Alexander and Wellmann, Florian}, year={2019}, month=jan, pages={1–32}, language={en} }
